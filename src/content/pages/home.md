### My Mission and Values

I'm striving to make the world a better place through software. I want to work with people and companies against climate change and white supremacy. The world is beautiful and amazing, and if we care, and actually try, we can [stop the world from burning up](https://nanransohoff.com/A-mental-model-for-combating-climate-change-846be1769d374fa1b5b855407c93da66). We can disassemble systems of oppression and shape a more equitable society. It will take so much more than software to save the planet and end oppression, but as an engineer, I want to do my part. I'm following modern best practices and principles of [sustainable](https://sustainablewebdesign.org/) and [ethical](https://www.ethicalweb.org/) web development.
